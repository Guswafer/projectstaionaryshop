Author's description:

All of my cursor sets (as of now) aren't mine. The person who made this cursor set is "aystic" on Deviantart. See their profile here: https://www.deviantart.com/aystic. And also, the links to the original sets, dark: https://www.deviantart.com/aystic/art/Volantes-Dark-879809065, and light here: https://www.deviantart.com/aystic/art/Volantes-Light-880018331. I asked them for permission and they said "Yes, but don't forget to credit me.", so here i am uploading this perfect set! If you like Dark or light simple cursor sets, then this set is definitely for you. Enjoy! :D
